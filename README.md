# Confessions-App
A Web-application to anonymously post your confessions.

## About:
This web-application was inspired by the Whispers App. University confessions page has been on the rise and this application was developed for users to anonymously post their confessions. This interface allows users to view their personal secrets/confessions theyâ€™ve made and other secrets that users have posted. In this project, I experimented with various authentication methods here as well. 


## How to run:
Please Note the use of API Keys and its secret ket for Google Auth in this project here.
1. Make sure you have Node.js installed
```
npm install
nodemon app.js
mongod
```

## How I built it and technologies used:
* I used Javascript EJS, express, 
* MongoDb for Secrets Database
* Google Authentication oAuth2.0 API
* Passport API for authentication for account information MongoDB database OR Google Sign In authentication
